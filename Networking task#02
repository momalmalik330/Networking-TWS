# üì° Common Networking Protocols & Their Relevance in DevOps

üëã Welcome! This document is created as part of the **#90DaysOfDevOps** challenge (Day 2), guided by [Shubham Londhe](https://twitter.com/Shubhamlondhe07). Today‚Äôs task is to understand commonly used networking protocols and their role in DevOps workflows.

## üîó What Are Protocols?

**Protocols** are rules that define how data is transmitted over networks. In DevOps, understanding these is essential for building, deploying, monitoring, and troubleshooting applications.

## üìã Common Protocols & Port Numbers

| Protocol | Port | Description | Relevance to DevOps |
|----------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **HTTP**  | 80   | HyperText Transfer Protocol | Used for web apps, REST APIs, and internal tooling interfaces. |
| **HTTPS** | 443  | HTTP Secure | Same as HTTP but encrypted. Used for secure access to APIs, dashboards, and websites. |
| **FTP**   | 21   | File Transfer Protocol | Transfers files between client and server. Legacy use in CI/CD file transfer. |
| **SFTP**  | 22   | Secure FTP (via SSH) | Secure alternative to FTP. Used in CI/CD pipelines to upload/download artifacts. |
| **SSH**   | 22   | Secure Shell | Securely access remote servers for configuration, deployment, and automation. |
| **DNS**   | 53   | Domain Name System | Resolves domain names into IP addresses. Critical for service discovery & deployments. |
| **SMTP**  | 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sends automated alert emails from monitoring tools or CI systems. |
| **SNMP**  | 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol | Monitors network and system health ‚Äî used in observability stacks. |
| **ICMP**  | N/A  | Internet Control Message Protocol | Not port-based. Used for "ping" and network reachability diagnostics. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Matters in DevOps

Understanding these protocols helps DevOps engineers:

- Automate deployments over secure channels (SSH/SFTP)
- Troubleshoot network or DNS issues quickly
- Monitor system uptime and health
- Set up CI/CD workflows that depend on file or API communication
- Configure infrastructure with tools like Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, etc.
