# 🔐 How to Create and Configure Security Groups in AWS

**Task (Day 3 - #90DaysOfDevOps)**: Understand and configure **Security Groups** — the virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources.

---

## 🧠 What is a Security Group?

A **Security Group** acts as a **virtual firewall** for EC2 instances to control:
- ✅ **Inbound traffic**: What is allowed *into* your instance
- ✅ **Outbound traffic**: What is allowed *out* from your instance

They are **stateful** — if you allow incoming traffic on a port, the response is automatically allowed.

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: Create & Configure Security Group

### ✅ Step 1: Login to AWS Console
Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), and open the **EC2 Dashboard**.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Navigate to Security Groups
- On the left panel, click **“Security Groups”** under **Network & Security**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Click “Create Security Group”
- Name: `my-devops-sg`
- Description: `Security group for DevOps EC2 instance`
- VPC: Select the default VPC (or your desired VPC)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Add Inbound Rules

Click **"Add Rule"** to define what type of incoming traffic is allowed.

| Type          | Protocol | Port Range | Source            | Use Case                  |
|---------------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| SSH           | TCP      | 22         | My IP             | Secure shell access       |
| HTTP          | TCP      | 80         | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) | Serve web app (non-SSL) |
| HTTPS         | TCP      | 443        | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) | Secure web access       |

---

### ✅ Step 5: Add Outbound Rules (optional)
By default, all outbound traffic is allowed. You can restrict if needed.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Create Security Group
Click **“Create security group”** to finish.

---

### ✅ Step 7: Attach Security Group to EC2
- When launching or modifying an EC2 instance, select your created security group under **"Configure Security Group"**.

## 🧩 DevOps Relevance

🔐 Security Groups are **essential for:
- Allowing CI/CD agents to connect to servers
- Ensuring apps only expose required
